## Anchor-Standards

#### Who is the Audience?

* (Director of Research)
* Curriculum Design staff

Our goal was to look at student performance as it relates to Anchor skills.  I first want to figure out the data structure.

##### Goals: 
* Interested in looking at the the Anchor skill trajectory of students through episodes.
* Which skills do students fluctuates the most on

##### Purpose: 
* We can better understand the impact of our games and curriculum:
      * Gain a baseline on our students 
      * Interested to see how students perform in the game as it relates to the teacher activity level within the platform. 
      * We could group teacher activity by tiers (get started activities, reporting activities, feedback) using their clickstream on our web  portal to the curriculum and student performance reports.  
   
* Ran summary statistics as it relates the the "student leveling and task" data.
* Then move on to establishing scripts that allow us to get baseline metrics

[Personal project]: I still have this data and I am now tinkering with association analysis, decision trees, and sequential analysis to predict students outcome based on previous performance.  Weâ€™ll add in the teacher activity data and begin to analysis if teacher activity on platform has an impact on student outcomes.
